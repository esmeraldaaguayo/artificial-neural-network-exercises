# artificial-neural-network-exercises
exercises from KU Leuven course Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## session 1
Implemented basic ANN models: perceptron and feedforward neural networks with hyperparameter tuning

## session 2
Explored recurrent neural networks in their application to time series predictions especifically hopfield networks and long short-term memory networks

## session 3
Neural networks for deep learning were analyzed including stacked autoencoders and convolutional neural networks
